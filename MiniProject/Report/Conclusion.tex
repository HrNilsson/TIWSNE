\chapter{Conclusion}

Based on the results and discussion chapters it can be concluded that this project does not conclusively confirm that image compression will reduce power consumption in a sensor network. However considering the calculations and design improvements presented in the discussion, compression can still be argued as a good approach to reducing energy consumption. Even though the results of this project do not verify this claim, this is due to the
