\chapter{Conclusion}

Based on the results and discussion chapters it can be concluded that this project does not conclusively confirm that image compression will reduce power consumption in a sensor network. However considering the calculations and design improvements presented in the discussion, compression can still be argued as a good approach to reducing energy consumption. Even though the results of this project do not support this argument, this is due to the poorly designed application, which keeps the radio circuits of both motes turned on during the entire transmission sequence.
